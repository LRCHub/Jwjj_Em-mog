Stark naked in front of my mirror
A pudgy person somehow did appear
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at
A big pot and tripley chin (Tripley chin)
Oh what condition my condition's in (Condition is in)
Laughing at myself but what a crying shame
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame?

Cyclamates, juicy steaks, sweet things too
Aren't always good as they seem
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too
That's what you get when you eat that way

I read a book on organic foods (Organic food)
Jumped on a health trip, put me in the mood (Right in the mood)
You may not get to perfect overnight
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd (Fairfax and 3rd)
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word (Give you the word)
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way
Salad with a special, knock you right off your seat
With carrot juice to wash it all down
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town

H.-E.-L.-P
Help through
Education creates
Love which manifests
Peace

Hamburgers and hot dogs, throw 'em all out
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today
And 'member now that H.E.L.P. 's on its way

(H.-E.-L.-P.)
